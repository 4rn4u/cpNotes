The Priority Queue is a model for a data collection that
allows to access to the element of highest priority.

It is essential that any data in the collection, d1, is
Comparable with another, d2, on the basis of its priority:

- d1 < d2 IFF the priority of d1 is higher than that of d2
- The data with the highest priority is the one that requires
  the minimum waiting time to be processed; equivalently,
  the highest priority data in a collection is its minimum.
- If we have two data with equal priority, FIFO access.
