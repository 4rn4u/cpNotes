Graphs represent binary relations between data ofa collection:

- A relation R over a set S is defined as a set of pairs (a, b) /a, b Î S
- If (a, b) Î R, it can be written as “a R b” and it denotes that a is related to b

A _directed graph_ (dg) is a pair G = (V, E)
• V is a finite set of vertices (or nodes)
• E is a set of directed edges, where an edge is an ordered
pair of vertices (u, v): u ® v

A _undirected graph_ (ndg) is a pair G = (V, E)
• V is a finite set of vertices
• E is a set of undirected edges, where an edge is a pair of
undirected vertices (u,v) = (v,u), u ¹ v: u ¾ v (∃ (u,v) → ∃
(v,u))

A _labelled graph_ is a graph G = (V, E) where a function is defined f: E ® L, with L is a set whose components are called labels:
• Note: the labelling function can be defined over V, the set of vertices

A _weighted graph_ is a graph labelled with real numbers (L º Â)
