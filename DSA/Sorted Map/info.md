Model: Sorted Map

- A Sorted Map is a dynamic set of x entries that:
- Efficiently supports the operations of a Map and also those of a Set (next in order or successor, previous in order or predecessor, maximum, minimum...).
- It maximises the advantages of Map and Sorted List and minimises their disadvantages.
- The estimated maximum cost of its basic operations is O(log n), that of Binary Search on a sorted static set.
